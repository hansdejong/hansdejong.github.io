### Popularisation
What every programming language needs to get popular, and most are lacking (including Scala) is attention for the Niche of Easily Showing Off Bright Ideas by Novice Programmers (the wellknown NESOBINP-principle). That means making it easy to make a GUI-application, preferably for the browser. 
Java used to have Swing for making Applets and Applications, and maybe Processing. NESOBINP (possibly including other kinds of software as for the Internet of Things, like for the Raspberry Pi) makes beginning programmers reach for a language, and start programming with ease. Scala-culture is focused on the complicated hi-end stuff. Nothing wrong with that, but don't forget NESOBINP! 

### Steps
In my opinion that takes three things (alternatives ignored):

* The Java-application-niche: reinstate and support Scala-swing for making offline GUI's.

* The Java-applet-niche: not only make the Scala.js tutorials palatable for absolute beginners, but also make a choice for a simple frontend js-browser-widget-library, make it cheap or free and support it. Also with examples: how to make browser-apps, with buttons, canvas, menu's ... Say everything Swing has. 

* Low level documentation. Flood the internet and bookstores with small examples and low-level introductions like in the former (?) computermagazines. Github is great, but intimidating for absolute beginners.

### Options
Simple means: just an interface to the js-lib. All the hard stuff should be Scala. I've no recent experience but once made this: <a href = "http://hansdejong.github.io/genetics/_scala/2017/01/03/FBG-etc/" target="_blank">Scala-gui-apps</a>. Webix is not free anymore, and I think I'm the only one who ever used it from Scala. I also tried Bootstrap, but there are more popular choices nowadays.
