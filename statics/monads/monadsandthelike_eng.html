	<h3>What I understand about it now</h3>
	<div class="klein">(Renarks / additions welcome.)</div>
	
<ul>
<li>It is all about operations on elements (values or functions), often encapsulated in a structure, a <b>context</b>.<br>
List and Maybe/Option for instance have a compound "kind" (metatype): they need an other type for construction. That makes them the context of the other type.<br>
The operations succeed if those elements  or structures obey a number of laws.<br>
Those laws often result in primitives, typeclass-methods.
<li>There are five groups (type-classes) of elements or structures. They obey an increasing number of laws, <br>
- to which lesser and lesser elements abide.<br>
- by which more and more operations are made possible.<br>
<li>There is a cesure between Monoid en Functor (Functor  is not a strict subclass of Monoid). Some Monads or Functors can act like a Monoid.<br>
<i>The last remark is not strictly true: Monoids always are concrete types (they don't need a typeparameter, like with <b>Int</b>, or those parameters are filled in, like with <b>List Char</b>).<br>
A Functor (and consequently also a Monad) demands a parameter (is a context).</i>
</ul>

<h3>Laws</h3>
<div class="klein">In the following S is a set with an associated binary operation O.<br>
Some "synonyms" may concern the same operation, but belong to different levels. Ap in this way is the Monad-version of &lt;*&gt; (Applicative Functor-version).</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Closure</b>: Applying O to two elements of S results in an element of S again.
<li><b>Associativity</b>: When combining pairs of elements order doesn't matter.
<div class="klein">(The order of the elements may matter, like in string-concatenation, but not the order of the operations, the location of the parenthesis.<br>
So subtraction is not associatif, (5 - 3) - 4 != 5 - (3 - 4))</div>
<li><b>Identity</b> or  <b>zero</b><!-- of  <b>unit</b> of <b>return</b>-->: there is an identityelement with an identity operation resulting in the starting-element.<br>
(With addition for instance this is 0, with multiplication 1, when calculating a maximum -&infin;.)
<li><b>Compose</b>: f(g(a)) = f&bull;g(a)
<li><b>Pure</b>, <b>unit</b> or <b>return</b>: def pure[A] (a:A) : F[A]<!--Verbeterd-->
<li><b>&lt;*></b> or <b>ap</b>: def ap[A, B] (fa:F[A]) (fab: F[ A=>B ]) : F[B]<br>
override def map [A,B] (fa: F[A]) (fab: A => B): F[B]=ap(fa)(pure(fab))
<li><b>flatMap</b> (or <b>bind, >>=</b>)
</ul>


<h3>The benefits of Monads for the programmer</h3>
<div class="klein">I'm just talking about Monads here. It will be clear that in some cases it is sufficient for instance to be a Functor.</div>
<ul>
<li>Many standardtypes, like Lists in Haskell and Scala, are bulkcontainers, and often they are Monads too. The same may be the case for self-defined types like a Tree.<br> 
Operations on the componenten thereof are often easy to combine or join (composing or chaining).<br>
Other bulkoperations deliver an over-all result (reducing or folding).

<li>"Smaller" standardtypes (like Maybe/Option of Haskell/Scala respectively) can be used to  elegantly handle exceptional cases.<br> 
If a component doen't exist or results in an exception this can be ignored, or the whole bulkoperation can be cancelled without endless if-then-else, case- or try-catch constructions.
<li>Monads are also used to handle operations with side-effects. This may be about reporting intermediate results (logging), IO-operations, random-input or state-maintenance.<br>
In pure functional code this is all impossible (functions deliver clear-cut results based on their input and don't change anything in the outside world).<br> Monads however present ways around these problems by incorporating the side-effect in the context and taking care of it in the implementation of <b>>>=</b>.<br> 
Especially in Haskell this kind of code is clearly distinguishable from pure functional code. (In Scala it is possible to cheat, but in Haskell side-effects are limited to this kind of Monads.)<br> 
In Scala the for-expression or comprehension is the ideal syntax to handle Monads.
<li>Functional languages are characterized by a focus on data-flow in stead of control-flow, and also by the use of very eleborate standardlibraries with optimized standardfunctions<br> for standard datastructures(that are often Monads).<br> 
This in contrast with the OOP (Object Oriented Programming) way of building custom datastructures with custom operations.<br>
The pure functional part of the code is consisting of a bunch of definitions or equations without impact on the outer world (as is usage in math),<br> 
more then of a sequence of instructions and statements (changing mutable variables) as is usual in especially imperative, but also OOP-code.<br>
The code is still sequential, but focus is far less on on the order of the instructions, 
because definitions, once defined, are easely gathered by the compiler.<br> With lazy evaluation the order even becomes irrelevant.<br>
For this reason it is often said that a functional programmer is more describing the what then the how.<br>
